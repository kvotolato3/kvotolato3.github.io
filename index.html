			My Experience <br>
			<small>I started in corporate services for 2.5 years and later moved into the software arena when I joined Maconomy in 2010.  Since then, I have moved up the ranks from Junior Consultant, to Consultant, to my current position as a Senior Consultant. As a consultant, I configure databases, conduct re-engineering sessions, document specifications, and write/modify code that is similar to HTML and CSS. Being in front of a client offers first-hand exposure to the issues users have, and so I have gained a real sense of what works and what doesn't from a user-experience perspective. <br> <br>

I have a Bachelor's degree in General Management from Simmons College and am currently pursuing a Master's in Finance from Harvard Extension School. <br><br> </small>

About me <br>
<small>I'm an intense, high-energy person, especially when it comes to work. I like to be challenged and to spend time being creative. I do a lot of research to obtain new skills and gain the skills needed to implement new ideas. In my current world, consultants are booked in a resource-planning tool as if they were inanimate objects, which I find hard to cope with because it removes the possibility of one managing his or her own schedule. Therefore, I'm now focusing on a career where I can be creative and get into a "flow" while doing my work. Although I'm intense, I'm also quiet and don't make a lot of small talk. That is not to say I'm anti-social. I'm just not very skilled at talking about superficial things because I'm more interested in diving into the details. <br><br>

Outside of work, there are a couple of hobbies I like to dabble in.
My biggest hobbies are running and gardening. Last year, I did a half marathon, "Boston's Run to Remember". I don't even remember my finishing time, but it was a blast, it felt great, and I had a lot of fun in process. I also like to plant a small kitchen garden in the summertime. Last year, I grew tomatoes, basil, parsley, and peas. The peas died really early on, though they tasted delicious. <br><br></small>
